## Description

**avatarbox.web** is an S3 website delivered via CloudFront. This resource also serves static content such as entry pages, error pages, web components, HTML includes, JSON data objects, stylesheets, images, scripts, and documents. It can handle request routing, compression, and caching (among other things). Transferring these front-end responsibilities over to S3 and CloudFront relieves the downstream servers to perform specialized application tasks.
